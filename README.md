# Unsupervised_Learning-K-means_PCA
Practice unsupervised methods, especially running K-means and visualizing the data using PCA. This notebook based on 'Fake and real news dataset', and 'Fashion MNIST' datasets from Kaggle.

In this Notebook, I will perform a few more things:

1. Load local files.
2. Load data from Kaggle.
3. Use Scikit-learn K-means.
4. Use Scikit-learn PCA.
5. Some visulaization.
6. Evaluate the performance of the clustering using Elbow methods, Siouhette analysis and accuracy.
