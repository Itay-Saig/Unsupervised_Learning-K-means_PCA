# Unsupervised_Learning-K-means_PCA
Practice unsupervised methods, especially running K-means and visualizing the data using PCA. 

In this notebook, the following steps are performed:

1. Load local files.
2. Load data from Kaggle.
3. Use Scikit-learn K-means.
4. Use Scikit-learn PCA.
5. Some visulaization.
6. Evaluate the performance of the clustering using Elbow methods, Siouhette analysis and accuracy.

The notebook is based on 'Fake and real news dataset', and 'Fashion MNIST' datasets from Kaggle, and was developed using Python.
